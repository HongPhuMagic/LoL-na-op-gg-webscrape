 # Webscraping League of legend players statistics

Selenium used on na.op.gg and stored in CSV file. You have the option to search any username of your choice.

There is a google ad in the footer of the page that could intercept with selenium. I couldn't find a way to close the footer ad so the workaround was to scroll the page all the way to the bottom. If you figured a way out, please feel free to help.
